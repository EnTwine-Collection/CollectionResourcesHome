This repository contains all repository material that accompanies the collection, _EnTwine: Critical and Creative Teaching With Twine_, published by Amherst College Press and co-edited by Emily Christina Murphy and Lai-Tze Fan in 2026. Links to these materials are also found in the print and open-access copies of the collection. 

You are free to fork, download, adapt, and use these resources. As the repositories linked here will stay static, individual authors may maintain and update their own repositories with more recent materials. We encourage you to go see what they're up to! As always, contributing back and crediting other instructors is greatly appreciated.
